    "text": "The Phytoplankton Vital Sign Project is curating phytoplankton-related data from Puget Sound into two separate digital repositories. The first is the Phytoplankton Data Inventory, which is a list of organizations conducting phytoplankton monitoring in Puget Sound waters and includes information on program objectives, metrics collected, sampling duration and frequency, site locations, and sampling and analytical methods. Data collected by these monitoring efforts are being compiled and ingested into a Phytoplankton Monitoring Database. This database will serve as the source of data for analyses of long-term trends and other statistical analyses relevant to identifying metrics or patterns for use in a phytoplankton-based Vital Sign.\nThe Phytoplankton Data Inventory will help improve understanding of the different methods being used across programs for collecting phytoplankton-related data. The Phytoplankton Monitoring Database will allow the project team to conduct statistical analyses of data to identify spatial and temporal patterns, trends in phytoplankton community metrics, and identify gaps in monitoring data. The inventory and database together will inform future Phase 3 work to create a single, large-scale regional metric (Vital Sign) for communicating ecosystem-scale status, trends and recovery in Puget Sound related to the phytoplankton community."
