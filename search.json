    "text": "The Phytoplankton Vital Sign Project is curating phytoplankton-related data from Puget Sound into two separate digital repositories. The first is the Phytoplankton Data Inventory, which is a list of organizations conducting phytoplankton monitoring in Puget Sound waters and includes information on program objectives, metrics collected, sampling duration and frequency, site locations, and sampling and analytical methods. Data collected by these monitoring efforts are being compiled and ingested into a Phytoplankton Monitoring Database. This database will serve as the source of data for analyses of long-term trends and other statistical analyses relevant to identifying metrics or patterns for use in a phytoplankton-based Vital Sign.\nThe Phytoplankton Data Inventory will help improve understanding of the different methods being used across programs for collecting phytoplankton-related data. The Phytoplankton Monitoring Database will allow the project team to conduct statistical analyses of data to identify spatial and temporal patterns, trends in phytoplankton community metrics, and identify gaps in monitoring data. The inventory and database together will inform future Phase 3 work to create a single, large-scale regional metric (Vital Sign) for communicating ecosystem-scale status, trends and recovery in Puget Sound related to the phytoplankton community."

The inventory does not include actual data points and measurements, which are being included in the Phytoplankton Monitoring Database. The data inventory was initiated during Phase 1 of the Phytoplankton Vital Sign Project and includes the following organizations: King County, Washington State Department of Ecology, Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, University of Washington, Kwaiht, NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center, Northwest Indian College, Ocean Research Academy, Pacific Shellfish Institute, Seattle Aquarium, Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians, Washington State Department of Health Biotoxin Program, Washington Sea Grant, Western Washington University and Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada.",
